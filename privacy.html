              <strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong><br>
              We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.<br>
              We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.<br>
              Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

              <strong>Security</strong><br>
              We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.<br>
              Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page.<br>
              While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
              We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help us improve our access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.<br>
              If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at (503) 936-7974 or via email.
